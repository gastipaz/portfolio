    "26 years old, born in Argentina but currently living in Italy. I have a degree in Communication, but shortly after my graduation realized that I wasn't passionate about it anymore. I then decided to search for a new spark, and that's what Software Development gave me. I immediately started learning as much as I could but eventually specialized myself in Python and React.js development. I'm now looking for a junior developer position that allows me to grow in the field and ultimately gain new experiences.",
